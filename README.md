Effectively a dead project. launched but without the traction I'd hoped for. feel free to salvage code for your own use.

It essentially allowed users to get alerts from tradingview on telegram or discord, or execute trades directly from the tradingview alerts using mt4/5. Mechanism was webhooks for trdingview and polling for the EA. Sounded great in my head, but idk.
